# Welcome to our code (ARC)
Contrary to popular belief, this is not where we store our main code. This package only exists so the FTC SDK knows where our opmodes ("entry points") are. The code in this package calls the `org.rowlandhall.arc`. All opmodes ("entry points") in this directory should call functions from said package. As always, you can find the original README [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode).
